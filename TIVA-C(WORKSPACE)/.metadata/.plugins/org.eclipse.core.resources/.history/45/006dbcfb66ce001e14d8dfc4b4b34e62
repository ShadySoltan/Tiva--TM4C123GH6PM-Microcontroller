/*Requirements:
    a) Same as exercise 4 in NVIC examples but MCU frequency is 16MHZ (NO PLL)

    b) Switch the access level to unprivileged by setting the bit 0 in the processor control register

    c) Call SysTick_Init after that it should trigger hard fault as SysTick and NVIC registers could not be
        accessed in the unprivileged access level. */
